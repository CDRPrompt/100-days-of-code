# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [CDR Prompt]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [12/22/2020].

## Log

### R1D1 
Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.

### R1D2
Day 2 in the books. Some things are starting to click but I did have to watch a video for help on one part. If I had just read the entire question, I would not have needed help. Stupid mistakes made and learned from.
